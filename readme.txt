Add Google reCAPTCHA to your WooCommerce Checkout, Login, and Registration Forms.

== Description ==

Easily add Google reCAPTCHA to WooCommerce checkout and forms to help prevent spam.

## Supported Forms ##

You can currently enable the reCAPTCHA on the following forms:

**WooCommerce**

* Checkout
* Login Form
* Registration Form
* Password Reset Form

**WordPress**

* Login Form
* Registration Form
* Password Reset Form

## Getting Started ##

Simply generate your Google reCAPTCHA v2 site "key" and "secret" and add these to the settings.

Choose which forms you want it to show on, and set the theme to either dark or light.

A new reCAPTCHA WooCommerce field will then be displayed on your checkout, and other selected forms to protect them from spam!

## Localisation ##

The language for the WooCommerce reCAPTCHA will be automatically set based on your sites default language.

## Is it free to use? ##

Yes, this plugin is completely free with no paid version, and it doesn't track your data. Google reCAPTCHA is also a completely free service!

## Alternative Plugin ##

Want a user-friendly, privacy-preserving reCAPTCHA alternative? Check out the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-cloudflare-turnstile/">Simple Cloudflare Turnstile</a> plugin instead (100% free).

== Installation ==

1. Upload 'recaptcha-woo' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Customise plugin settings in WordPress admin at Settings > reCAPTCHA WooCommerce
